# Matrix Starter

Matrix Starter is a modern and highly customizable WordPress theme that uses ACF Builder and Tailwind CSS to streamline development. Modular by its structure, it includes a robust set of tools and features to help you build custom WordPress themes quickly and efficiently.

## Clone and Install

Follow these steps to clone the repository and set up the project on your local machine. We recommend using **Local by Flywheel** and cloning straight to your theme folder for testing and development.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* **PHP** (version 7.4 or higher)
* **Composer** (Dependency Manager for PHP)
* **Node.js** (which includes npm)
* **Git** (Version Control System)
* **WordPress** (Installed locally or on a server)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bernardhanna/matrix-starter.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd matrix-starter
   ```

3. **Install PHP Dependencies**

   Make sure Composer is installed: [getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org/)

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

4. **Install JavaScript Dependencies**

   Ensure Node.js and npm are installed: [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Create and Configure `.env` File**

   Create a `.env` by copying the example:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Then open `.env` and add your WordPress path (the folder that contains `wp-config.php` / `wp-load.php`).
   If your path contains spaces (e.g., Local by Flywheel), **wrap it in quotes**:

   ```dotenv
   # Path to your WordPress root
   # Example (Local by Flywheel):
   WP_PATH="/Users/yourname/Local Sites/your-site/app/public"
   ```

   > The installer **only reads** `.env`; it does not modify or delete it.

6. **Run Development Server with Watchers**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will:

   * Watch and process CSS changes
   * Watch and process JS changes
   * Start the Webpack dev server with hot reloading

### Additional Steps

7. **Build the Assets for Production**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

8. **Set Up WordPress**

   * **Place the Theme in WordPress:**

     Copy the `matrix-starter` theme folder to your WordPress installation’s `wp-content/themes/` directory (skip if you already cloned directly into `wp-content/themes`):

     ```bash
     cp -R ./matrix-starter /path-to-your-wordpress/wp-content/themes/
     ```

   * **(Optional) Activate the Theme via WP Admin:**

     Log in to **Appearance → Themes** and activate **Matrix Starter**.

9. **Install & Activate Required Items (Theme + Plugins)**

   This command will:

   * Clone **Matrix Component Importer**
   * Clone **Matrix Sitemap Generator**
   * Attempt to **activate both plugins**
   * Attempt to **activate the theme** (best-effort; the script will not fail if activation isn’t possible)
   
 ```
   cd /scripts
  ```
   ```bash
   npm run flexi:install
   ```

   When complete, you can visit the Matrix Components importer UI:

   ```
   /wp-admin/admin.php?page=matrix-ci-admin-page
   ```

### Troubleshooting

* **Local by Flywheel tips:**

  * Make sure the site is **running** in Local.
  * For smoothest results, open **Local → Open Site Shell** and run:

    ```bash
    npm run flexi:install
    ```
* **Activation skipped or failed:**

  * Double-check `WP_PATH` in `.env` (and make sure it’s **quoted** if it includes spaces).
  * You can manually activate via WP-CLI:

    ```bash
    wp --path="$WP_PATH" plugin activate matrix-component-importer matrix-sitemap-generator --skip-plugins --skip-themes
    wp --path="$WP_PATH" theme activate matrix-starter --skip-plugins --skip-themes
    ```
* **Composer Not Found:**

  * Install and add to PATH: [getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org/)
* **npm Errors:**

  * Check versions:

    ```bash
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```
* **Permission Issues:**

  * Consider using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or adjusting file permissions.

### E2E Smoke Tests

Run multisite smoke checks (Ireland/UK/AU/Global):

```bash
npm run test:e2e:network
```

The default target is:

```text
http://localhost:10014
```

You can override with:

```bash
BASE_URL="http://your-local-domain-or-port" npm run test:e2e:network
```

### Contact Form Smoke Test

Run the structured contact form smoke test:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:contact-form
```

Run it in headed/live browser mode:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:contact-form:live
```

If your contact form is on a different page, set the path:

```bash
CONTACT_FORM_PATH="/contact-us/" npm run test:e2e:contact-form:live
```

To submit the form (instead of fill-only smoke mode), set:

```bash
CONTACT_FORM_SUBMIT=1 CONTACT_FORM_PATH="/contact-us/" npm run test:e2e:contact-form:live
```

Note: `CONTACT_FORM_SUBMIT=1` can send real emails to recipients configured in the Contact Form block (and BCC if configured).

### Theme Tokens (for fast site duplication)

To re-skin this theme quickly for a new client/site, update semantic tokens in `tailwind.config.js`:

- `THEME_TOKENS.brand` for primary/secondary/accent brand colors
- `THEME_TOKENS.text` for heading/body/muted text colors
- `THEME_TOKENS.surface` for page/panel/background colors
- `THEME_TOKENS.shape` for field/card/pill radii
- `THEME_TOKENS.size` for touch target and form field heights

These tokens are additive and mapped to existing values by default, so current styles stay visually consistent.

#### New semantic utility examples

- `bg-brand-primary`, `hover:bg-brand-primary-hover`
- `text-content-heading`, `text-content-muted`
- `bg-surface-page`, `bg-surface-warm`
- `rounded-field`, `rounded-card`, `rounded-pill`
- `min-h-touch`, `min-h-field`

#### Accessibility helpers

- `a11y-focus` for consistent `:focus-visible` ring
- `tap-target` for minimum 44px interactive hit area
- `hocus:` variant to share hover + keyboard focus styles (example: `hocus:bg-brand-primary-hover`)
